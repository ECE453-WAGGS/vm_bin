# vm_bin
Random scripts for use on the Ubuntu VM

Before using any of the scripts that interact with the ZedBoard over the network, you must update the ZED_IP bash variable to the current IP address for the ZedBoard.

The two most important scripts are cp_boot_sd and scp_boot_zed.  These are used to copy the BOOT partition files to either the SD card or directly to the ZedBoard.
